# MegaETH Oracle Dashboard Improvement Plan

## Overview

This plan addresses the unique challenges of displaying oracle price data on MegaETH, where multiple price updates can occur within the same block/timestamp due to miniblocks, causing visual issues and poor UX.

## Current Issues Identified

1. **Vertical Line Problem**: Multiple price points plotted at the exact same timestamp create vertical lines
2. **Batch Animation Issue**: All new points appear at once every second instead of smooth progressive animations
3. **Log Index Ordering**: Need to use log index to distinguish order within the same block/timestamp
4. **Visual Polish**: Need smoother, more engaging animations for real-time data

## Technical Analysis

- **Data Structure**: `id: ${event.chainId}_${event.block.number}_${event.logIndex}`
- **Current Refresh**: 1-second intervals with batch updates
- **Chart Library**: Chart.js with react-chartjs-2
- **Data Sources**: Redstone (TransparentUpgradeableProxy_ValueUpdate) & Chainlink (AccessControlledOCR2Aggregator_AnswerUpdated)

## Solution Strategy

### Phase 1: Data Processing Enhancement ✅

#### 1.1 Extract Log Index from ID

- [ ] Create utility function to extract `logIndex` from the existing ID format
- [ ] Add `logIndex` field to the `PriceUpdate` interface
- [ ] Update data mapping to include log index extraction

#### 1.2 Sub-second Timestamp Distribution

- [ ] Group price updates by timestamp
- [ ] For each timestamp group, distribute points across the second based on log index
- [ ] Formula: `adjustedTimestamp = originalTimestamp + (logIndex / maxLogIndexInGroup) * 1000`
- [ ] Ensure chronological ordering within each second

#### 1.3 Data Deduplication Options

- [ ] Implement optional deduplication by `(block.number, dataFeedId, updatedAt)`
- [ ] Add toggle for showing all transactions vs. unique price points
- [ ] Maintain both views for different analysis needs

### Phase 2: Animation System ✅

#### 2.1 Progressive Point Animation

- [ ] Create animation queue system for new data points
- [ ] Implement staggered animation timing (e.g., 100ms between points)
- [ ] Add smooth entrance animations for new points
- [ ] Prevent animation overlap with existing chart zoom/pan

#### 2.2 Real-time Data Buffer

- [ ] Implement data buffer to store incoming points
- [ ] Process buffer with animation timing instead of immediate rendering
- [ ] Add configurable animation speed (fast/medium/slow modes)

#### 2.3 Visual Effects

- [ ] Add point entrance animations (scale-in, fade-in)
- [ ] Implement highlight animation for newest points
- [ ] Add pulse effect for price changes
- [ ] Create smooth line drawing animation between points

### Phase 3: Chart Optimization ✅

#### 3.1 Custom Chart Plugin

- [ ] Create custom Chart.js plugin for progressive point rendering
- [ ] Override default animation behavior for new data
- [ ] Implement frame-based animation control
- [ ] Add animation pause/resume functionality

#### 3.2 Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement point pooling to prevent memory leaks
- [ ] Add data windowing for large datasets
- [ ] Optimize re-renders to only animate new points
- [ ] Add configurable performance modes

#### 3.3 User Controls

- [ ] Add animation speed controls (off/slow/medium/fast)
- [ ] Implement animation play/pause button
- [ ] Add "Skip to Latest" functionality
- [ ] Create smooth auto-scroll to follow new data

### Phase 4: UI/UX Enhancements ✅

#### 4.1 Animation Feedback

- [ ] Add loading indicator during data processing
- [ ] Show animation progress for large batches
- [ ] Display animation queue status
- [ ] Add visual feedback for data freshness

#### 4.2 Chart Controls Enhancement

- [ ] Improve zoom controls with animation awareness
- [ ] Add smooth transitions between time ranges
- [ ] Implement smart auto-zoom to show recent activity
- [ ] Add animation-friendly tooltip behavior

#### 4.3 Data Visualization Modes

- [ ] **Miniblock Mode**: Show all transactions with log index spacing
- [ ] **Simplified Mode**: Show only unique price changes
- [ ] **Analysis Mode**: Highlight price deviations and patterns
- [ ] Add mode toggle with smooth transitions

### Phase 5: Advanced Features ✅

#### 5.1 MegaETH-Specific Features

- [ ] Add miniblock visualization indicator
- [ ] Show block number and log index in tooltips
- [ ] Implement block-based filtering
- [ ] Add MegaETH network status indicator

#### 5.2 Animation Presets

- [ ] **Real-time Mode**: Fast animations for live monitoring
- [ ] **Analysis Mode**: Slower, detailed animations for analysis
- [ ] **Demo Mode**: Smooth, polished animations for presentations
- [ ] **Performance Mode**: Minimal animations for older devices

#### 5.3 Data Export

- [ ] Export animated sequences as video/gif
- [ ] Save animation configurations
- [ ] Export processed data with adjusted timestamps

## Implementation Checklist

### File Modifications Required

- [ ] `components/PriceComparisonChart.tsx` - Main component overhaul
- [ ] `lib/utils.ts` - Add utility functions for log index extraction
- [ ] `lib/animation.ts` - New file for animation system
- [ ] `lib/data-processing.ts` - New file for timestamp distribution logic
- [ ] `types/index.ts` - New file for type definitions

### New Components to Create

- [ ] `components/AnimationControls.tsx` - Animation speed/pause controls
- [ ] `components/DataModeToggle.tsx` - Toggle between visualization modes
- [ ] `components/ChartLegend.tsx` - Enhanced legend with animation status
- [ ] `hooks/useAnimatedData.ts` - Custom hook for data animation
- [ ] `hooks/useLogIndexProcessor.ts` - Custom hook for log index processing

### Dependencies to Add

- [ ] `framer-motion` - For smooth UI animations
- [ ] `use-interval` - For precise animation timing
- [ ] `zustand` - For animation state management (optional)

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Unit tests for log index extraction
- [ ] Integration tests for animation system
- [ ] Performance tests with large datasets
- [ ] Visual regression tests for animations
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 1 (Week 1): Data Processing

Focus on fixing the core timestamp distribution issue

### Phase 2 (Week 1-2): Basic Animation

Implement progressive point rendering

### Phase 3 (Week 2): Chart Integration

Integrate animations with existing chart functionality

### Phase 4 (Week 3): UI Polish

Add controls and visual enhancements

### Phase 5 (Week 4): Advanced Features
